---

The PayMee API solution was developed using `REST` technology. As a market standard, `REST` is independent of the technology used by the integrating party, allowing integration through the vast majority of programming languages, such as:

* `ASP`
* `ASP.NET`
* `Java`
* `PHP`
* `Ruby`
* `Python`, etc.

Key features that stand out in the PayMee platform include:

* **No Proprietary Apps:** It is not necessary under any circumstances to install proprietary applications in the virtual shop environment.
* **Simplicity:** The communication protocol used is purely `HTTPS`.
* **Ease of Testing:** The PayMee platform offers a publicly accessible **Sandbox environment**. This allows developers to create test accounts, making the integration start easier and faster.
* **Credentials Handling:** The customer’s credentials (`x-api-key` and `x-api-token`) are securely transmitted in the header of the `HTTP` request.
* **Safety:** Information exchange always occurs directly between the store's `Server` and PayMee's `Server`, meaning it does not pass through the buyer’s browser.
* **Multiplatform:** Integration is performed through the `REST Web Service`, ensuring compatibility across various platforms.
