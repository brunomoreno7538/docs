## About Sandbox

To facilitate testing during integration, PayMee offers a **Sandbox environment**. This environment allows you to test your integration thoroughly without affecting live data. It comprises two main areas:

1.  **Test Account Registration:** Where you can sign up for test credentials.
2.  **Transactional Endpoint:** The specific URL for sending API requests in the test environment.

All Sandbox API requests should be sent to the following endpoint:
[https://apisandbox.paymee.com.br](https://apisandbox.paymee.com.br)

## Advantages of Using the Sandbox

* **No Affiliation Required:** You don't need to be a formally approved merchant to start testing in the Sandbox.
* **Easy Credential Generation:** Simply access the Sandbox Registration page, create an account, and you will receive the `x-api-key` and `x-api-token` needed for authenticating your test API calls.
