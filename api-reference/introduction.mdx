## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to guide the developer on how to integrate with PayMee. It describes the features and methods to be used, lists the information to be sent and received, and provides examples.

## Required Knowledge

The integration mechanism with PayMee is straightforward. Intermediate knowledge in the following areas is required to successfully deploy the PayMee solution:

* Web programming languages
* `HTTP`/`HTTPS` requests
* `JSON` file manipulation

## API Operations

In this manual, you will find references to all operations available via the PayMee `API REST`. These operations require authentication using specific keys (`x-api-key` and `x-api-token`) sent in the request headers.

### Environments

Requests should be directed to the appropriate environment endpoint:

* **Production Environment:** For live transactions.
    [https://api.paymee.com.br/](https://api.paymee.com.br/)

* **Sandbox Environment:** For testing and development.
    [https://apisandbox.paymee.com.br/](https://apisandbox.paymee.com.br/)

### Making Requests

To perform an operation:

1.  Combine the base URL of the chosen environment (Production or Sandbox) with the resource (`URI`) of the desired operation.
2.  Send the request using the `HTTP` verb specified for that operation (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).
3.  Include your `x-api-key` and `x-api-token` in the request headers for authentication.
