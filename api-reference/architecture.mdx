Integration with PayMee is performed through **Web Services**. The model employed is quite simple, utilizing two main base URLs (endpoints):

* **Production Endpoint:** For live, real-time operations.
    [https://api.paymee.com.br/](https://api.paymee.com.br/)

* **Sandbox Endpoint:** For testing and development.
    [https://apisandbox.paymee.com.br/](https://apisandbox.paymee.com.br/)

These endpoints receive `HTTP` messages using standard methods (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`). Each message type must be sent to a specific **resource**, identified by its path (URI) appended to the base endpoint URL.

## HTTP Methods

The primary `HTTP` methods used by the PayMee API are detailed below:

| Method | Description                                                                 | Example Usage                          |
| :----- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | Used to **create** new resources or send information to be processed.       | Creating a new transaction.            |
| `PUT`  | Used to **update** an already existing resource.                             | Refunding or canceling a transaction. |
| `GET`  | Used for **querying** (retrieving information about) existing resources. | Querying transaction details.        |
