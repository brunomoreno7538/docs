title: 'Webhook Notifications'
description: 'Receiving real-time event notifications from PayMee via webhooks, including authentication, examples, and response formats.'
---

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications about events related to your PayMee transactions, such as payment confirmations, reversals, or refunds. These are essential for keeping your system synchronized with the status of payments without needing to poll the API constantly.

## Notification Mechanism

PayMee sends **Notification Posts** to a URL you configure in your PayMee merchant panel. These notifications are triggered based on specific events occurring within the PayMee system.

* **Method:** `POST`
* **Protocol:** `HTTP` / `HTTPS` (HTTPS is strongly recommended for security)
* **Configurable Events:** You can select which events trigger a notification in your panel. Common event types that can be configured include:

    | Event Context | Notifiable Statuses / Events      |
    | :------------ | :-------------------------------- |
    | Sale          | `PAID`, `REVERSAL`                |
    | Transfer      | `PAID`                            |
    | Payout        | `PAID`, `FAILED`                  |
    | Refund        | `PAID`                            |
    | Reversal      | `PENDING`, `PAID`, `CANCELLED`    |
    *Note: This table provides a general overview. Consult your PayMee panel for the exact configuration options available for your account.*

## Authentication

Webhook notifications sent by PayMee use **HTTP Basic Authentication** for security, ensuring that the requests genuinely originate from PayMee.

* **Username:** Your PayMee `x-api-key`
* **Password:** Your PayMee `x-api-token`

Your webhook listener endpoint **must** validate these credentials from the `Authorization` header of incoming requests before processing the payload.

**Example Basic Auth Header Construction:**

1.  **Combine Credentials:** Concatenate your API key and token, separated by a colon (`:`).
    *Example:* `af38b751-30d7-4261-a9fb-ea30f6ece609:28331f43-e2b3-4078-9502-5f656fb66cdf`

2.  **Encode with Base64:** Encode the resulting string using Base64.
    *Example Encoded Value:* `YWYzOGI3NTEtMzBkNy00MjYxLWE5ZmItZWEzMGY2ZWNlNjA5OjI4MzMxZjQzLWUyYjMtNDA3OC05NTAyLTVmNjU2ZmI2NmNkZg==`

3.  **Construct Header:** The `Authorization` header sent by PayMee will look like this:
    ```http
    Authorization: Basic YWYzOGI3NTEtMzBkNy00MjYxLWE5ZmItZWEzMGY2ZWNlNjA5OjI4MzMxZjQzLWUyYjMtNDA3OC05NTAyLTVmNjU2ZmI2NmNkZg==
    ```
## Expected Response & Retries

For **all** types of webhook notifications received from PayMee:

* Your callback URL **must** respond promptly with an `HTTP 200 OK` status code to acknowledge successful receipt and acceptance of the notification. Any other status code (or a timeout) will be interpreted as a failure.
* If PayMee does not receive a `200 OK` status, it will automatically retry sending the notification to ensure delivery.
* Retries occur at approximately **60-second intervals**.
* PayMee will attempt a maximum of **5 retries** after the initial failure.
* **Idempotency:** It's crucial to design your webhook handler to be idempotent. This means processing the same notification multiple times should not result in duplicate actions or inconsistent states in your system, as network issues could lead to retries even if you processed the notification initially. Using the `saleToken` or `uuid` from the payload is a common way to check if an event has already been processed.
